Project 3: Pig Game

Each player takes turns rolling dice, the score of each dice roll adds up and the current player has the option
to "bank" the amount of points stored. If the player rolls a "1", they lose their unbanked points and ends their
turn.

Once any players score reaches 100, they win the game.
